## Analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Distribution of Age**: Analyzed the age distribution to understand the age range of customers and how it relates to bike purchases.
2. **Gender Distribution**: Examined the distribution of male and female customers to identify any significant differences in purchasing behavior.
3. **Income Distribution**: Investigated income ranges to see how economic backgrounds affect bike purchasing decisions.
4. **Number of Bikes Purchased by Gender**: Compared bike purchases between genders to target marketing efforts.
5. **Average Income by Occupation**: Analyzed how different occupations relate to income levels and bike purchases.
6. **Income Distribution by Bike Purchase**: Explored if income patterns differ between those who purchased bikes and those who did not.
7. **Age Brackets Distribution**: Studied the distribution of age brackets to segment the market effectively.
8. **Marital Status vs Purchased Bike**: Examined the impact of marital status on bike purchasing behavior.
9. **Home Owner vs Purchased Bike**: Analyzed how home ownership status affects the likelihood of purchasing a bike.
10. **Commute Distance vs Purchased Bike**: Investigated if commute distance influences bike purchasing decisions.

### Pair Plot

A pair plot was created to visualize relationships between selected numerical features such as Age, Income, Children, Cars, and Bike Purchase. This helps in understanding the interactions between these features and their influence on bike purchases.
